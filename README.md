* do lat/long
* make a bar chart of ridership based on specific date

### Kevin :/
* make the leaflet
* getting all the days of the year and getting next / last
* learn how to sort by min / max / alphabetical

### Done
* Leaflet displays chicago by default with a zoom, currently has no marker


### FINAL TODO: 
* Add a min-max sort to the big graph
* add inputs / conditionalPane to switch between alphabetical / minmax for the big graph
* have map click pull up station
* Radio buttons to select the map background

#### Would be really nice to have
* line colored markers on map
